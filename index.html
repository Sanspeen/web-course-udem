                    Hi! I'm Santiago Franco Software engineer and fullstack developer
                    from Medellin, Colombia, 21 years old who is excited to learn a lot
                    about software development in all their fields, I have two years of two
                    years of experience developing sowftware and teaching about this
                    kind of topics. I'd gotten experience in programming languajes as:
                    Python, Java, Typescript and Javascript.
                    Nowadays I'm focused in web development and I have more than
                    one year of experience about it with knowledges as: HTML, CSS,
                    Javascript, Typescript and two frameworks for frontend: Angular and
                    React; for backend development I have experience with: Python

                    development time is: GIT, SQL, NoSQL, Firebase services, Excel,
                    Word and PowerPoint, JMeter.
                    In my case i really like the idea that is more worth it working in team
                    than alone and in cause of it I'd learned how to implement agile
                    metodologies in my jobs like: Scrum or Kanban task board.
